Hey Anthony,

I’m so excited because this month we’ll finally be launching our Street-Smart Japanese Foundations course for complete beginners!

That means that 2024 could be the year you finally feel confident enough to practice your Japanese with strangers, friends, or family members.

This brand new program is perfct for you if you're a complete newbie, or if you've learned some Japanese before but you still can't speak it.?

The course means a lot to our team because we’ve been working for years to bring you high-quality videos that expose you to real-world conversations.
